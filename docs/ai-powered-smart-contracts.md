# AI-Powered Smart Contracts
The AI-Powered Smart Contracts component is a revolutionary technology that integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning with blockchain-based smart contracts. This component enables the creation of intelligent, autonomous, and adaptive smart contracts that can optimize themselves in real-time.

## AI Model Training
The AI-Powered Smart Contracts component uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and large datasets to train AI models that can optimize smart contract execution. The training process involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection

The component collects a large dataset of smart contract executions, including input parameters, execution outcomes, and performance metrics.

```python
1. # Import required libraries
2. import pandas as pd
3. 
4. # Collect smart contract execution data
5. data = pd.read_csv('smart_contract_data.csv')
```
2. Data Preprocessing

The component preprocesses the collected data using techniques such as feature scaling, normalization, and feature selection.

```python
1. # Import required libraries
2. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
3. 
4. # Preprocess the data
5. scaler = StandardScaler()
6. data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data)
```

3. AI Model Training

The component trains an AI model using the preprocessed data. The model is trained to predict optimal smart contract execution parameters and outcomes.

```python
1. # Import required libraries
2. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
3. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
4. from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
5. 
6. # Split the data into training and testing sets
7. X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data_scaled.drop('outcome', axis=1), data_scaled['outcome'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
8. 
9. # Train the AI model
10. model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
11. model.fit(X_train, y_train)
12. 
13. # Evaluate the model
14. y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
15. print('Model MSE:', mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Smart Contract Optimization

The AI-Powered Smart Contracts component uses the trained AI model to optimize smart contract execution in real-time. The optimization process involves the following steps:

### 1. Smart Contract Execution

The component executes the smart contract with input parameters predicted by the AI model.

```python
1. # Import required libraries
2. from web3 import Web3
3. 
4. # Execute the smart contract
5. w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID'))
6. contract_address = '0x...your_contract_address...'
7. contract_abi = [...your_contract_abi...]
8. 
9. # Execute the smart contract with predicted input parameters
10. tx_hash = w3.eth.send_transaction({'from': '0x...your_account_address...', 'to': contract_address, 'value': 0, 'gas': 200000, 'gasPrice': 20, 'data': contract_abi.encode_function_call('execute', [predicted_input_parameters])})
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

The component monitors the performance of the smart contract execution and adjusts the input parameters in real-time using the AI model.

``` python
1. # Monitor the smart contract execution performance
2. performance_metrics = get_performance_metrics(tx_hash)
3. 
4. # Adjust the input parameters using the AI model
5. adjusted_input_parameters = model.predict(performance_metrics)
6. 
7. # Re-execute the smart contract with adjusted input parameters
8. tx_hash = w3.eth.send_transaction({'from': '0x...your_account_address...', 'to': contract_address, 'value': 0, 'gas': 9. 200000, 'gasPrice': 20, 'data': contract_abi.encode_function_call('execute', [adjusted_input_parameters])})
```
